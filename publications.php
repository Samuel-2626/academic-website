                    <li>My participation at the German Government’s sponsored 21st International Training Workshop for Rural Youth Leaders held between June and July, 2002, at the Bavarian Farmers’ Union Training Centre, in Herrsching, Germany under the patronship of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) offered me the opportunity to develop and present an action interventionist’s plan for Nigeria. The action plan led to my initiation of the <a href="http://acrye-ng.org" target="blank">African Centre for Rural Youth Empowerment (ACRYE) <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> - a holistic development initiative creating opportunities for youth between 18 and 30 years old residing in rural communities of Nigeria, for the purpose of empowering them for a decent livelihood, which was inaugurated on the 11th of November, 2004. I also wrote and published a book – entitled: Ethical Revolution among Nigerian Youth in Schools and Colleges for the purpose of generating fund to sustain the Centre, which was recommended and listed as Civic text bookfor JSS class students in Osun State by the State Ministry of Education. The Centre is currently experimenting its first phase of its Small Business Support Scheme (SBSS), a micro-credit product which I developed for the purpose of mobilizing fund for empowering rural young men and women for a decent livelihood. </li>
